            <p>Welcome to my page folks! Let me tell you about myself! I am Eritrean American, born and raised in Berkeley, California. 
                I'm a pretty curious person and like to try new things(within reason &#128540;).
                I love family time and hanging with the crew because its guaranteed to bring me good laughs and love. I have a business management background and was running
                our family store. Can't wait to tell you my hobbies and why I chose coding! Just scroll down! :)
                </p>

<strong>
    <img src="./Images/Onepunchman.jpg" class="onepunchman">
    <p>Honestly, I love watching anime and reading manga. I really do spend a lot of my time off on animes/mangas(aside from hanging with family and friends) like One Piece, Naruto, Solo Leveling, HunterxHunter etc etc. 
        I think what resonates with me the most, is that a lot of these animes have a main character who never quits and/or is an underdog. A lot of people ask me for dependable sites to read manga. This is my go to site, just click on the logo:
        <a href="https://manga4life.com/"> <img src="./Images/manga4lifelogo.png" class="manga4life"> </a>! <br>
        On the more active side, I like to hike and play sports. California has a lot of cool trails to hike with beautiful scenaries. I like to play basketball with friends, which is something I've been doing since I was a child. Its an effortless way for me to get some good cardio without noticing the burn, ha!
        I'll be honest, I was a social media addict(Instagram to be specific) but I'm going on one week of being clean. Plan to continue that while I'm in this bootcamp. Need my focus to be laser level.
        I'm in between vegan and vegetarian and like to eat  a lot, even when its not in my best interest. So I guess I'm a foodie by default!

<h1>Why Coding?</h1>
<strong class="coding">
    <img src="./Images/Codingmeme.gif" class="cdmeme">
    <p> That's the million dollar question. I'm some what of a generalist. I like to try new and different things. And coding is something that I've considered targeting for awhile. I have a few family members and friends that code, whom have told me on numerous occasions to give it a chance.
        But I brushed it aside because I didn't have the time to fully commit to learning it. However, our store got leased to a family friend at the beginning of this year which in turn left me free to roam!
        I wasted no time and immediately signed up for a coding bootcamp. I know learning how to code can open up a large door of opportunities and avenues. I'm always looking for a new challenge and this is the challenge that I picked for the first quarter of 2023! 
        They told me coding would be a whirlwind of emotions and I'm ready for them all!
